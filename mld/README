The MOST Linux Driver

HISTORY OF CHANGES
==================

1.3.12
-----

- usb-hdm: added support for USB gadget OS81210
- usb-hdm: added arbitrary access to DCI registers
- usb-hdm: added possibility to internally sync the endpoint logic of the
  controller
- made diverse code improvements


1.3.11
-----

- dim2-hdm: fixed random data at the beginning of the synchronous streams
- networking-aim: fixed interrupt unsafe spinlocks that may be the reason of
  the kernel hang


1.3.10
-----

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash possible by closing the USB channel while traffic
- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash due to the race in the handling of the endpoint
  stall condition
- dim2-hdm: fixed kernel freeze possible when reusing the dim2 channel
- v4l2-aim: fixed kernel crash due to interrupt unsafe spinlocks
- v4l2-aim: assigned different names for the different devices (video devices
  get the hardware dependent names and the V4L devices names may be set
  using the driver configuration which is similar to the cdev-aim)


1.3.9
-----

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash appeared when closing the active channel
- dim2-hdm: added possibility to configure the parameter (fcnt) representing
  the number of frames per internal DIM2 sub-buffer for synchronous channels


1.3.8
-----

- usb-hdm: fixed kernel crash caused by the wrong handling of the endpoint
  stall condition (regression in the version 1.3.7)
- dim2-hdm: fixed race by closing the DIM2 channel


1.3.7
-----

- usb-hdm: added product id for OS81119
- usb-hdm: fixed handling of the endpoint stall condition
- made diverse code improvements


1.3.6
-----

- core: fixed race between probe_channel and most_start_channel
- core: fixed potential minor number leak
- core: fixed issues by removing the link to channel
- aim-cdev: fixed races by closing the channels
- aim-cdev: fixed potential MBO leak
- aim-cdev: poll: fixed issue with waking the sleeping process
- aim-network: added rx_dropped statistics
- made diverse code improvements


1.3.5
-----

- aim-cdev: added support of the poll syscall
- dim2-hdm: fixed reordering by IO operations
- made diverse small code improvements


1.3.4
-----

- aim-sound: improved stability of ALSA 5.1
- aim-sound: more information about fails in kernel log
- core: fixed regression in most_deregister_interface appeared in 1.3.2


1.3.3
-----

- aim-sound: added ALSA 5.1 support
- core: added fair distribution of buffers
- usb-hdm: fixed doing DMA on stack
- usb-hdm: fixed MAC address representation
- dim2-hdm: fixed too big buffer size for DIM2
- made diverse small code improvements


1.3.2
-----

- fixed sync request (over USB interface) for OS81118 Rev.D
- fixed multi-AIM support
  (simultaneous MEP/MDP is possible)
- made diverse small code improvements

known issues

- arbitration for simultaneous MEP/MDP is not fair


1.3.1
-----

changes

- fixed 1.3.0 regression: babble on in pipe of USB-HDM
  (fixes synchronous and isochronous Rx over USB)


1.3.0
-----

changes

- fixed spin_lock/spin_unlock unmatching by unloading V4L-AIM
- fixed MAC address representation for PCIe-INIC
- fixed incompatibilities to current PCIe-INIC firmware
- fixed race between register_netdev() and ndo_open()
  (no crash by opening device exact after registering)
- fixed bug blocking open of character devices
- fixed endianess issues in USB-HDM if running with USB-INIC RevD
- removed noisy kernel logs
- fixed resource leak by closing character device
- made diverse small code improvements

known issues

- possible endianess issues in representation of MAC address by USB-HDM
  if running with USB-INIC RevC
- multi-AIM support doesn't work
  (simultaneous MEP/MDP is not possible)
- USB-HDM is not working properly in virtual environment
  (babble on IN pipe)
